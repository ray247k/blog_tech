      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using free blogging platforms like Blogger.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;However, with the rise of personal branding awareness in recent years and feeling limited by the features of the original blog,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;not to mention the inconvenience of moving, and the inability to customize SEO and embed tracking codes,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I felt the need to take matters into my own hands.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Having worked in the media industry, I realized that if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I initially moved from Blogger to Medium, then back to Blogger, finding the transition quite cumbersome.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Furthermore, the formatting of code content often gets distorted, and I wanted to record everything using Markdown syntax.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This led me to consider self-hosting, partly as a platform to showcase my skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

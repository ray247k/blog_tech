      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always had a question &amp;ldquo;Should I use value for type in struct? Or using pointer?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
After reading many different projects on the web, it seems that they all have different practices.&lt;br&gt;
Until I recently encountered a problem that gave me some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using FFmpeg to convert media files</title>
      <link>https://tech.ray247k.com/en/blog/202301-ffmpeg-video-convert/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we can use certain methods to download the .M3U8 file and then merge it into a .ts file.&lt;br&gt;
However, computers usually cannot directly play this format.&lt;br&gt;
We can use FFmpeg to convert it into a common .mp4 file for easy playback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) may look similar.&lt;br&gt;
But in reality, they are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better clarify the differences between the two, let&amp;rsquo;s compare the notes on both services side by side.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Serverless 101</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since our company&amp;rsquo;s services are built on AWS and heavily rely on various serverless computing services,&lt;br&gt;
I had no prior experience in this area.
This series serves as a compilation of notes for me,&lt;br&gt;
and its content may be subject to constant revisions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interacting with smart contracts using Golang</title>
      <link>https://tech.ray247k.com/en/blog/202207-go-ethereum-abigen/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, I was calling Smart Contracts through PHP, which raised two issues.&lt;br&gt;
One was the slowness, and the other was the lack of maintenance of the package.&lt;br&gt;
Fortunately, Golang provides an official package that is both fast and solves these two problems.&lt;br&gt;
This article explains how to convert existing Smart Contract ABIs into a Go package for interacting with contracts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Create a Redis service on GCP</title>
      <link>https://tech.ray247k.com/en/blog/202206-gcp-redis/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GCP offers the Google Cloud MemoryStore service for creating Redis or Memcached caching machine services.&lt;br&gt;
The pricing is similar to that of setting up a database.&lt;br&gt;
I thought it would be as inexpensive as using virtual machines (VMs).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Make your computer be temporarily accessible on the internet. - Ngrok</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In development, it is often encountered that testing on the local machine requires a publicly accessible URL for services.&lt;br&gt;
Or webhooks to use as a callback. Moreover, these services often require HTTPS certification.&lt;br&gt;
Are there any other options besides setting up a cloud server for this purpose?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the context of Laravel development environment setup, both official and unofficial sources offer a plethora of approaches.&lt;br&gt;

    "body": "Sometimes, we can use certain methods to download the .M3U8 file and then merge it into a .ts file.\nHowever, computers usually cannot directly play this format.\nWe can use FFmpeg to convert it into a common .mp4 file for easy playback.\nInstallation First, we need to download FFmpeg. If you are a Mac user, you can install it using Homebrew .\nbrew install ffmpeg To check if the installation is successful, you can use the following command:\nffmpeg -version Convert media files Once you have installed it, the next step is file conversion.\nUse the following command and replace the source .ts file and the destination path with your own target path:\nffmpeg -i /source_path/vedio.ts -acodec copy -vcodec copy -f mp4 /target_path/new_vedio.mp4 After executing the command, you will be able to see the converted file in the target path!\nWith FFmpeg, you no longer need to install additional software or rely on online file conversion services.\n",
